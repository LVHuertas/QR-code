## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Desktop-first design

### What I learned

I'm starting learning HTML/CSS to create web pages. For this, I used what Frontend gave me to perfomance the solution. I did it as Desktop-first, even when I know it's better Mobile-first. 

I really liked to development a solution for this QR code and I'm glad for what I made. Also, it was easy for me, althoght I don't now if I have errors or problems in CSS or HTML. 

### Continued development

I'd love to use in future projects Mobile-first, and even using Grid Layout or Flexbox to improve abilities on them.
